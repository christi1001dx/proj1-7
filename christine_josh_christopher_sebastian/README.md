Onesuppon - A collaborative story tool
--------------------------------------

Onesuppon is a tool that allows many people to collaboratively write a story over the internet. It will allow each user to contribute a tiny bit to the end of a story, or fork the story at any point to make the plot go in a totally different direction. All stories start with the common root "Once upon a time...", and from there can be expanded, forked, and grown to fill virtually any genre or plotline.
